If you already have `az cli` installed, make sure that you use the latest version. To make sure, run the following command

```bash

## Test your azure account with `az cli`

Open your terminal (bash, cmd or powershell) and login to your azure account by running this command

```bash
# Login using your Azure account
az login

# Get a list of available subscriptions
az account list -o table

# Set subscription by subscription id
az account set --subscription  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

# Set subscription by name
az account set --subscription subscription_name
```

## Register Microsoft.ContainerService Service provider to your Azure subscription

If you are deploying an AKS service for the first time in your subscription, you need to register the `Microsoft.ContainerService` service provider to avoid deployment errors.

```bash
# Register Microsoft.ContainerService provider
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.ContainerService'
```
