# Workshop #5 - scaling options for applications and clusters in AKS

![logo](images/logo.png)

This is an introduction level workshop that covers scaling options for applications and clusters in AKS and you will learn:

* What kind of scaling options are available for applications and clusters in AKS
* How to manually scale pods and nodes
* What is Horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) and how does it work
* How cluster autoscaler works
* What is Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler ([KEDA](https://keda.sh/)) and how to use it to scale your applications

## Agenda

Here is the preliminary agenda for the workshops (still work in progress and subject to change):
 
 * Welcome
 * Lab-01 - provision AKS cluster and supporting resources (20 min)
 * Scaling applications in AKS concepts (slides)
 * Lab-02 - manually scale applications in AKS
 * Lab-03 - use Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) to automatically scale applications
 * Scaling AKS cluster concepts (slides)
 * Lab-04 - manually scale the node count in an AKS cluster 
 * Lab-05 - use cluster autoscaler to automatically scale an AKS cluster to meet application demands
 * Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling KEDA (slides)
 * Lab-06 - deploy KEDA
